# "Castle" (working title!):

is a Python-powered, text-adventure game that I'm currently building in small, weekly bites. This project is borne out of my love for old-school text-adventure games and my *absolute hatred* for game-navigation using the NSEW method; instead, players navigate via a fast-map that is updated as new rooms/areas are discovered (no more pages and pages of notes of "two west, five down" to interrupt gameplay!) Progress between rooms requires puzzle-solving and the discovery of exits (doors, windows, trapdoors, etc.) that lead to new rooms.

Objects and Rooms in-game are modeled entirely on a class based system and split into separate modules (class_models, objects, rooms) to make everything easy to track and update.
